				<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>After building my first pc, I decided to try out coding. I immediately fell in love
					with it. While coding, hours would pass as I worked on coding problems. These problems would 
					get stuck in my head and I couldn't stop thinking about different ways to code the problem. I am 
					so excited to continue my journey to becoming a software developer with Thinkful!</p>
					<p> My other interest are sports and video games. My favorite sports are football, baseball,
					 MMA, soccer, and a little basketball.</p>
